# project-i-prototype

My site is a dnd stat block generator. The player's vital statistics (all of those required to 
maintin the character) are supported by the site. The players can be saved into a database, 
and can be retrieved as a list of names and classes or in greater detail using the character's
name as a parameter. Players fetched with the get list on the left can be clicked on to pull 
up the character's stats. I did not support as many tertiary stats as I hoped to, due to time 
crunch, but the project does label buttons using colour according to the class of the character, 
which had been an above and beyond goal. I would expand the character sheet that is updated based 
on the stats to contain more affected stats, and would probably format it in the style of a dnd 
character sheet if I had more time.
